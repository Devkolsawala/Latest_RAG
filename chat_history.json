Without it, cost data cannot be matched to GA4 events, making accurate attribution impossible. |\n| **Official Confirmation** | \u2022 Google Ads docs: apps do **not** automatically receive GCLID. <br>\u2022 Firebase docs: developers must capture GCLID via Install Referrer and log it as an event or user property. <br>\u2022 Install Referrer API is the **only** official source for GCLID. <br>\u2022 GA4 BigQuery export schema supports `event_params.key = 'gclid'`. |\n| **End\u2011to\u2011End Flow** | 1. **Google Ads** (auto\u2011tagging ON) \u2192 2. **GCLID generated** \u2192 3. **User clicks ad \u2192 app install** \u2192 4. **Install Referrer** captures GCLID \u2192 5. **App logs GCLID to GA4** \u2192 6. **GA4 \u2192 BigQuery export** \u2192 7. **Google Ads API** returns cost + GCLID \u2192 8. **BigQuery JOIN** on GCLID \u2192 9. **Device\u2011model\u2011wise spend report** |\n| **Step\u2011by\u2011Step Breakdown** | 1. Auto\u2011tagging ensures each click gets a GCLID. <br>2. Ad click passes `?gclid=xxxx` via install referrer. <br>3. GA4 auto\u2011collects device data (brand, model, category). <br>4. GCLID + device data exported to BigQuery. <br>5. Google Ads API pulls cost data keyed by GCLID. <br>6. BigQuery SQL joins GA4 and Ads data on GCLID to aggregate spend by device model. |\n| **Android Implementation** | 1. **Add dependency**: `implementation 'com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer:2.2'`. <br>2. **Capture GCLID** using `InstallReferrerClient`: <br>```kotlin<br>val referrerClient = InstallReferrerClient.newBuilder(context).build()<br>referrerClient.startConnection(object : InstallReferrerStateListener {<br>    override fun onInstallReferrerSetupFinished(responseCode: Int) {<br>        if (responseCode == InstallReferrerClient.InstallReferrerResponse.OK) {<br>            val referrerUrl = referrerClient.installReferrer.installReferrer<br>            val gclid = Uri.parse(\"https://dummy?$referrerUrl\").getQueryParameter(\"gclid\")<br>            if (gclid != null) {<br>                val bundle = Bundle().apply { putString(\"gclid\", gclid) }<br>                FirebaseAnalytics.getInstance(context).logEvent(\"gclid_capture\", bundle)<br>                FirebaseAnalytics.getInstance(context).setUserProperty(\"gclid\", gclid)<br>            }<br>        }<br>    }<br>    override fun onInstallReferrerServiceDisconnected() {}<br>})<br>```<br>3. **Verify**: In GA4 DebugView, confirm the `gclid_capture` event and `gclid` user property appear. |\n| **BigQuery Example** | ```sql<br>SELECT ga.device.mobile_model_name AS device_model,<br>       SUM(ads.cost_micros/1000000) AS total_spend<br>FROM ga4_table ga<br>JOIN google_ads_cost ads ON ga.gclid = ads.gclid<br>GROUP BY device_model;<br>``` |\n\n**Bottom line:** To attribute Google Ads spend to specific Android devices, developers must manually extract the GCLID from the Install Referrer, log it to GA4 as an event/user property, and then join GA4 data with Google Ads cost data in BigQuery using the GCLID. This process is fully supported by Google\u2019s official documentation and is the industry\u2011standard method for Android app attribution."
