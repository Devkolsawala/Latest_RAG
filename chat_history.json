Introduction** | Explains the full implementation of GCLID tracking for Android apps, covering proof of concept, Google references, end\u2011to\u2011end flow, BigQuery integration, and steps to capture GCLID in GA4. |\n| **2. Why GCLID Is Needed** | GCLID is the unique click identifier from Google Ads. It is essential to link Google Ads cost data with GA4 user data, enabling accurate device\u2011level ad spend attribution. Without GCLID, accurate attribution is impossible. |\n| **3. Proof That This Method Is Official & Industry Standard** | \u2022 **Google Docs**: Apps do not automatically receive GCLID; developers must capture it via Install Referrer. <br>\u2022 **Install Referrer**: The only official method to retrieve GCLID (no deep links, GA4 alone, or web fallback). <br>\u2022 **BigQuery Schema**: GA4 export supports `event_params.key = 'gclid'` and `event_params.value.string_value`, confirming GA4 can store manually logged GCLID. |\n| **4. GCLID End\u2011to\u2011End Flowchart** | 1. Google Ads (auto\u2011tagging ON) \u2192 2. GCLID generated \u2192 3. User clicks ad \u2192 4. Install Referrer captures GCLID \u2192 5. App sends GCLID to GA4 \u2192 6. GA4 \u2192 BigQuery export \u2192 7. Google Ads API provides cost + GCLID \u2192 8. BigQuery JOIN on GCLID \u2192 9. Device\u2011model\u2011wise spend report. |\n| **5. Step\u2011by\u2011Step Explanation** | 1. **Google Ads** generates GCLID when auto\u2011tagging is enabled. <br>2. User clicks the ad; GCLID passes via install referrer. <br>3. GA4 automatically logs device details (brand, model, category). <br>4. App forwards GCLID to GA4. <br>5. GA4 exports data to BigQuery (GCLID and device info). <br>6. Google Ads API returns GCLID + cost (example GAQL query provided). <br>7. BigQuery joins GA4 data with Ads cost on GCLID to produce spend reports. |\n| **6. How to Capture GCLID in Android App (Official Method)** | \u2022 **Dependency**: `implementation 'com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer:2.2'` <br>\u2022 **Code**: Uses `InstallReferrerClient` to fetch the install referrer string, extracts the `gclid` query parameter, logs an event (`gclid_capture`) and sets a user property (`gclid`) in Firebase Analytics. <br>\u2022 **Verification**: Check GA4 DebugView for the `gclid_capture` event and the GCLID value. |\n| **7. Verification in GA4 DebugView** | Open GA4 \u2192 DebugView to confirm receipt of `gclid_capture` event with the correct GCLID. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nTo attribute Google Ads spend accurately in GA4 for Android apps, developers must manually capture the GCLID via the Google Play Install Referrer API, send it to GA4 as an event/user property, and then join this data with Google Ads cost data in BigQuery using the GCLID as the key. This process is fully supported by Google\u2019s official documentation and BigQuery schema."
